This project is a Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction System.   It uses a dataset containing various health metrics (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease.   The goal is to analyze medical data, preprocess it, train models, and make accurate predictions.
