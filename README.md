# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction System**.  
It uses a dataset containing various health metrics (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease.  
The goal is to **analyze medical data, preprocess it, train models, and make accurate predictions**.
